     It hardly touched the benchmark which is really wierd...

     It made just about no difference, but it'll make generation a bit
     faster...

     Made the adjustment but it looks like it's worse and I think that it's
     because I zip it and reallocate on each evaluation of fitness.

     Worked like a charm with higher order zipWith functions.

     This was incidentally fixed when I separated the fitness vector out.

     I'm really not sure.  So I'm moving onto something else while I leave
     my brain to figure it all out.

     I removed this so that I wouldn't allocate as much.
