     It hardly touched the benchmark which is really wierd...

     It made just about no difference, but it'll make generation a bit
     faster...

** TODO Separate the fitness vector from the move vector
** TODO Use an Int for a missile
** TODO Use an Int for Each Move
** TODO Cache Fitnesses when searching deeper
** TODO Use Vector Algorithms binary search for `chooseOne'
** TODO Add rewrite rules and always use map* varients of functions
** TODO Make a type for each row state
** TODO Do some maths!!!
** TODO Check for collision with the player when there are no towers on the row
